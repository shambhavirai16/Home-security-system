- It is a project built during Microsoft Engage 2022 program.
## Face Recognition
This program processes frames from live video to detect faces and compares against a list of known face encodings with the help of OpenCV. 

## How does it work
- If the face is not recognised, the person is regarded as an intruder and an email is sent along with the frame attached by invoking a shell script. 
- If the face is known, nothing is done.
